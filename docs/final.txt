| Game Physics Final Proposal

/* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * */

Purpose:
	We will create a physics sandbox application within a custom C++ framework.

	We will use MemeLib (ML) as our base, and port the physics code from Animal3D (A3).

/* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * */

Motivation:
	Our main motivation is learning for the sake of learning.

	We were taught physics in C, so we feel it would be a good learning opportunity to reimplement A3's physics in C++.

	We feel that impementing a physics sandbox within our own custom framework will 
	be a good way to further our understanding of game physics and engine design.

Scope:
	ML already has graphics/gui code, the base framework is mostly complete.
	
	We will need to implement some math functions, port A3's physics code, and build an interface.
	
	C++ has operator overloading, so porting A3 should not be too difficult.
	
	ML is single threaded, so a physics thread may need to be implemented.

	We feel that we will be able to accomplish our goals in the time allotted.
