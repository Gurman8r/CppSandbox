High Concept:
	To create a physics sandbox in MemeLib (ML).

Motivation:
	We were taught physics in C, so we feel it would be a good learning opportunity to reimplement animal3d's physics in C++.

Scope:
	ML already has graphics/gui code, the base framework is mostly complete.
	We need to implement some math functions, port animal3D's physics code, and build an interface.
